Thu, 25 May 2017 21:09:42 GMT

### Minor changes

- During dev-deploy, allow the user to specify a test page using the  dev_deploy_url environment variable. The task will then print a full URL, which helps reduce the need for manual string manipulation during testing
- Updated manifest processing to support "version": "*" to automatically get the version from the package.json. All other cases now leave the manifest unmodified
- Updated the webpack visualization plugin to use webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Upgraded to Webpack 2.0
- Added IConfigEntry
- Updated to TypeScript 2.2
- Added an --entry flag, which limits the webpack task to only bundling certain entries, which can be specified using their alias or id
- Removed "shouldWrapProductionManifestForManifestServer" config property from the write-manifests task
- Added the ability to exclude filename hashes for the CopyAssets task
- Ensured the "*" version is replaced with the real version in the produced JS file
- Fixed an issue where globs wouldn't work correctly when running in Docker
- Fixed a minor issue where localized paths in debug manifests produced in --ship mode are missing a default entry
- Allowed manifest JSON files to have comments
- Ensured that multiple config.json entries don't point to the same input or output filenames
- Included CSS as a default extension that's automatically copied from src to lib
- Allowed the webpack stats data files to be dropped in a location in addition to temp/stats
- Debug manifests should respect debugLocale in manifest's localized strings
- Lock loader-utils version, as newer version shows deprecation warnings when using css-loader
